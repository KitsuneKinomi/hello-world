# hello-world
This is a tutorial repository to help get my feet wet with using GitHub.

This is Kitsune, I'm a programmer playing around with GitHub. I used it some in college but I mostly just want a place to stick my personal projects. I suppose this is a very literal interpretation of what a 'Hello World' repository would be.
